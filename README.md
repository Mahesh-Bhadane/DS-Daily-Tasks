Problem 1
Implement the following in C.

Given a static array and  a number X, return whether any 2 numbers from given array represents their sum as X.


Problem 2
Consider an integer array X, determine the new array Y such that each element of at i index of Y array contains product of all elements of X array except that index element.

Problem 3
Let us consider a=1, b=2..... z=26 alphabets with codes. If any coded word is given then identify in how many ways that coded word is written in the alphabet form.
Minimum length of coded word is 3 . 001 is not allowed.

Example:-
Input- 123
Output- "123" can be represented in alphabetical form in 3 ways "ABC"(A-1,B-2,C-3) , "LC"(L-12, C-3), "AW"(A-1,W-23)

Problem 4
Consider the string s and an interger X , identify the longest substring with  length  that contains at most X distinct characters.

Eg . s= "abcba" X = 2 , the longest substring with X distinct characters "bcb"

Problem 5
Implement the system such that for given a string s and set strings identify all strings in the set that have s as prefix.


Problem 6
Rotate clockwise or anticlockwise given array of size n by X elements.

-- It would be [4,5,1,2,3] clockwise and [3,4,5,1,2] anticlockwise
-- In above task one dimensional array was used.

Problem 7
Use 2 D array (matrix) then apply clockwise and anticlockwise rotation(90°) on the given matrix.
